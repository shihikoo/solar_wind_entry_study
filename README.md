# solar_wind_entry_study

To statistical find out the conditions that lead to strong solar wind entry from sheath into the magentosphere using MMS data, we track the He++/H+ density ratio changes from sheath into plasamsheet.
#### we valide the solar wind data by compare ratio with WIND SWE data.
#### we sort the data with nature of crossing, by IMF orientation, and by activity.
